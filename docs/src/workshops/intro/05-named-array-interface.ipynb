    "### Plots.jl Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common probjem in Julia, and a few packages provide a unified interface to multiple backends. The best example of this is Plots.jl, which itself is not really a plotting library, it is more of an abstraction over existing plotting backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, plots would be used by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "using Plots\n",
    "gr()\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 1:10; y = rand(10, 2) # 2 columns means two lines\n",
    "plot(x, y, title = \"Two Lines\", label = [\"Line 1\" \"Line 2\"], lw = 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "plot(x, y, seriestype = :scatter, title = \"My Scatter Plot\")\n",
    "\n",
    "p1 = plot(x, y) # Make a line plot\n",
    "p2 = scatter(x, y) # Make a scatter plot\n",
    "p3 = plot(x, y, xlabel = \"This one is labelled\", lw = 3, title = \"Subtitle\")\n",
    "p4 = histogram(x, y) # Four histograms each with 10 points? Why not!\n",
    "plot(p1, p2, p3, p4, layout = (2, 2), legend = false)\n",
    "\n",
    "# etc...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above would use the GR framework backend to create the plots, as `gr()` was called after the plotting module was imported. If you change the line from `gr()` to `plotly()`, the same functions would run and produce the equivalent plots with plotly, same if you use `pyplot()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very neat approach, as one single line allows you to completely chang the backend for the rest of the code. For plotting this is very useful as you may want to use an interactive plotting backend, like plotly, when exploring the data initially, but then change to a more performance-orientated backend, like GR, for the final product or when running headless.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not clear to me if this much flexibility would be needed, and creating this might add a lot of really unecessary abstraction overhead. Such an implementation is not [that complex if you are faimiliar with julia](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl/blob/master/src/backends.jl) but it does rely on some advanced julia metaprogramming concepts, which would be quite offputting to newcommers."

    "- A function with a declared return type converts its return value to that type.\n",
    "- Passing a value to ccall converts it to the corresponding argument type.\n",
    "\n",
