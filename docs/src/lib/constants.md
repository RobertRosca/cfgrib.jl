# [Constants](@id lib_constants)

Constants contains a number of constant arrays and dictionaries used to define
which keys and attributes are expected to be present in a GRIB message, how to
map grid types to correct representations of the data, etc...

These constants are shown in the documentation for ease of use and reference
purposes.
